## Content
Throughout a period of a month, we were asked to build a functional compiler incorporating basic, intermediate and advanced features.
In the below files you will find: <br />
<br />
[compiler_tests](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Drim/tree/master/compiler_tests): Contains 87 test cases to test the functionality of our implemented features. <br />
[doc](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Drim/tree/master/doc) : Contains information on our coursework specifications and a management timeline file explaining the progress of this project within the dedicated time. <br />
[include](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Drim/tree/master/include) : Contains all of our Abstract Syntax Trees header files linking the nodes of our Parser properly. <br />
[src](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Drim/tree/master/src): Contains our Lexer, Parser and Code Generation code as well as other files to ensure their functionality. <br />
[test](https://github.com/LangProc/langproc-2020-cw-Drim/tree/master/test): Contains the reference files and output files generated by the automated test_compiler.sh bash script allowing us to verify the accuracy of our implemented features. <br />
<br />
## Features implemented in this compiler 

**BASIC FEATURES:**
- a file containing just a single function with no arguments
- variables of int type
- local variables
- arithmetic and logical expressions
- if-then-else statements
- while loops <br />

**INTERMEDIATE FEATURES:**
- files containing multiple functions that call each other
- functions that take up to four parameters
- for loops
- arrays declared globally (i.e. outside of any function in your file)
- arrays declared locally (i.e. inside a function)
- reading and writing elements of an array
- recursive function calls 
- the enum keyword
- the break and continue keywords <br />

**ADVANCED FEATURES:**
- variables of double, float, char, unsigned
- calling externally-defined functions (i.e. the file being compiled declares a function, but its definition is provided in a different file that is linked in later on)
- functions that take more than four parameters
- locally scoped variable declarations (e.g. a variable that is declared inside the body of a while loop, such as while(...) { int x = ...; ... }.
- the sizeof(...) function (which takes either a type or a variable)
